In this project, you will develop a File Integrity Checker using Python in Visual Studio. The tool’s main purpose is to monitor and detect changes in files by calculating and comparing cryptographic hash values.
You’ll write a Python script that uses built-in libraries like hashlib to generate unique hashes (e.g., SHA-256) for selected files. By saving these hashes and periodically re-checking them, the script can identify any modifications, deletions, or additions. This ensures that file integrity is maintained and helps detect unauthorized or accidental changes.By implementing this tool in Visual Studio, you can benefit from its integrated development environment: structured editing, debugging tools, and version control support. The final deliverable will be a clear, maintainable Python script ready to check file integrity across different folders or systems.This task combines practical programming skills with cybersecurity principles, making it ideal for anyone aiming to strengthen their understanding of data security and integrity verification.
